## Why this project?
Bitwarden stands out as one of the premier password managers available today. However, it lacks a critical feature for software developers: the management and injection of SSH keys. This project addresses this significant shortcoming, thereby enabling even advanced users to fully appreciate and be satisfied with this password manager.

## Dependecies
 - [Bitwarden CLI](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/)
